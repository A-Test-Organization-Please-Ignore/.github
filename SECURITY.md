# Reporting security issues
In the event that you come across a security vulnerability, exploit, or other sensitive issue regarding the viewer, it is important that this guide is followed carefully.

# What is considered a security issues?
Any bug that can, but not limited to:
1. Bypass asset permission restrictions
2. Expose private data of other residents (Passwords, emails, etc)
3. Allow access to other residents' accounts without their explicit permission
4. Allow remote code execution on another resident's computer

# What to do when you discover a security issue?
It is **IMPORTANT** to not disclose this in-world, or to share it with anyone outside of the Linden Lab or The Firestorm Team.

If the issue is related to Second Life, and not the Firestorm viewer, please report the issue to Linden Lab by following their security issues guide at:<br/>
https://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Security_issues.<br/>
The Firestorm Team **CANNOT** assist with Second Life related security issues, other than to point you in the right direction.

If you do not have a account on the Firestorm Jira, please create one before proceeding. You can find a guide on how to do so here:<br/>
https://wiki.firestormviewer.org/file_a_jira#creating_an_account

Please file your report **as a support request**! This way the report stays private and is seen as soon as possible. We will move the issue to the bug tracker with private status, or to our internal project as needed so that it remains private.<br/>
